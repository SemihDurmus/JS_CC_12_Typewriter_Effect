<!-- OVERVIEW -->

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- JS, HTML, CSS


## Features

- User can state the waiting time in milliseconds in th input. 
- This indicates the waiting time between the characters of the string to show up in the screen. Smaller waiting times makes the text display faster.
- One tip is that JS can not add new lines. Solution is that we can add `<br/>` to `.innerHTML`. We can check it by adding an if state to see if the current character is `\n`
- It's also wise to add a longer time at the end of the lines.
